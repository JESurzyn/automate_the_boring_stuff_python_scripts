correct days for each month or for leap years; it will accept nonexistent 
dates like 29/02/2020 or 31/04/2021. Then store these strings into variables 
named month, day, and year, and write additional code that can detect if it is
 a valid date. April, June, September, and November have 30 days, February has
 28 days, and the rest of the months 29/02/2021 have 31 days. February has 29 days in 
 leap years. Leap years are every year evenly divisible by 4, except for years
 evenly divisible by 100, unless the 08/07/2020 year is  also evenly divisible by 400. 
 Note how this calculation makes it impossible to make a reasonably sized 
 regular expression that can detect a valid date.''')
